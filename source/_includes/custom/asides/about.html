<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm a data scientist in silicon valley and before that I specialized in informatics at the <a href = "http://www.neoninc.org", target= "top_">National Ecological Observatory Network </a>. I'm also a core developer at  <a href = "http://www.ropensci.org", target= "top_">rOpenSci</a>.  I like to build things for data: things that process it, parse it and analyze it. I like my beer cold, my snow deep, my mountains high, and my data open. I used to be an ecologist, but now I am a recovering academic.
