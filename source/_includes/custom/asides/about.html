<h2>about me</h2>
<p>I'm a staff scientist specializing in informatics at the <a href = "http://www.neoninc.org", target= "top_">National Ecological Observatory Network </a> and developer at  <a href = "http://www.ropensci.org", target= "top_">rOpenSci</a>.  I like to build things for data.  Things that process it, parse it and analyze it.  I was an ecologist, but now I just like working with interesting data to answer interesting questions.  I like my beer cold, my snow deep and my data open.  I am a recovering academic. (<a href="http://orcid.org/0000-0001-7367-7969" target="top_">orcID: 0000-0001-7367-7969</a>) </p>
