Here's a blog that I came across while looking up some things on<a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/03/04/network-theory-part-1/" target="_blank"> network theory</a>, its called <a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Azimuth</a> written by<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/" target="_blank"> John Baez</a> a mathematician over at UC Riverside (but currently in Singapore).  While its often very math heavy posts that are outside of my depth, I've really enjoyed reading some of his posts on climate change change like this one on the <a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/22/this-weeks-finds-week-317/" target="_blank">ice ages</a> and other biological topics like <a href="http://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2011/07/06/operads-and-the-tree-of-life/" target="_blank">phylogenetics</a> .  So its definitely a blog worth checking out.</div>
