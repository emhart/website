Here's a chance to post-doc with Jeremy Fox (the ever thoughtful man behind the curtain at the <a href="http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/">Oikos Blog)</a>, which would be awesome.  In the words of the Oatmeal it would be: "Like making out with a unicorn".  Here is the ad. <br><br><hr><br><br> "I am once again seeking applicants for the Killam postdoc. This is a competitive, 2-year postdoc awarded by the University of Calgary in any academic discipline. The award provides a salary of $45,000 CAD/year, health benefits, and a research/relocation allowance of $6000. <br><br>The awardee would be expected to develop their own independent research on some topic of mutual interest to themselves and their faculty mentor (that would be me). I welcome applicants interested in pursuing fundamental research in any area of population, community, or evolutionary ecology. I would be particularly interested in applicants interested in collaborating with David Vasseur (Yale University) and I on theoretical and/or empirical research on spatial synchrony, but my interests are by no means limited to this topic. <br><br>To be eligible, you must have completed your PhD sometime after Sept. 1, 2009, or else anticipate completion by Sept. 1, 2012. <br><br>Application deadline is Dec. 15, 2011 (that's the departmental deadline; one applicant will be selected by my dept. for consideration at the university level in Jan. 2012). The application needs to include a research proposal; prospective applicants should contact me well in advance to discuss this. <br><br>For more on the Killam postdoc, see <a href="http://www.grad.ucalgary.ca/awards/award_competitions/killam_postdoctoral_awards">http://www.grad.ucalgary.ca/awards/award_competitions/killam_postdoctoral_awards</a><br><br>For more on my lab, see <a href="http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/%7Ejefox/Home.htm">http://homepages.ucalgary.ca/%7Ejefox/Home.htm</a><br><br>Please circulate this in your dept., and bring it to the attention of any potential applicants."</div>

Ok, you need to remember here that I&#39;m a Morin lab alum. We share with our supervisor a certain reserve. At least I do. Peter once went to Texas to give a talk and greeted his host Mathew Leibold by saying &quot;HiMathewdon&#39;thugme.&quot; Just like that, all one word. So speaking as a Morin lab alum, and with no ill will at all, I have to say, &quot;ThanksTedbutdon&#39;tkissme.&quot; ;-)<br /><br />Working in my lab is indeed awesome, but it&#39;s also something people really can do (and would want to do, I hope). It&#39;s awesome in the way that petting a cute kitten is awesome, not awesome in the way that kissing an imaginary horse would be awesome. ;-)</div>

Oh no, I mean it as a complement. I would want to be your post-doc.  Similar to the amazingness of unicorns.  Look at this unicorn make-out scene... http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tqSwUoP1NK0  or this oatmeal unicorn comic:  http://mingle2.com/dating/unicorn  Unicorn awesomeness is deeply entrenched in the zeitgeist.  </div>

&quot;it would be: &quot;Like making out with a unicorn&quot;.&quot;<br /><br />Ummm...thanks?? I think? As long as you can avoid being accidentally stabbed by my massive, narwhal-like horn?<br /><br />You know, the more I think about it the less sure I am that this is a complement...</div>
