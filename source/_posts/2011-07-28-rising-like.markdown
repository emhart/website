Well, I've realized that I need to up the quality of this blog for it to be something I'm really proud of, so I've ditched my current theme for a new one.   I was using this as a forum solely to  explore current ecological literature.  That worked for a bit but fell to the wayside.  So I've decided to make it more general.  I chose distributed ecology as a title because I like the idea of ecological thought like distributed computing.  Lots of us scientists like little nodes around the web thinking and processing ideas into something great.  So to that end I've come up with the apt but uninspired title "Distributed ecology".  I might change it if I come up with something more pithy, or just leave it if I become famous in the ecology blog world.  If I were a betting man, I'd bet on the former though :).</div>
