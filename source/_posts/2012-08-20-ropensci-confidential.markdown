It's official, I've joined the rOpenSci team.  If for some reason you've found my blog but don't know what rOpenSci is (I find that a bit hard to believe though), it's a group of developers devoted to making open science tools for R. Our goal is to make data access and data gathering as easy as possible by coding up R-wrappers for API calls to open data sources.  Basically we make it easier for you to get data into your working environment (R) without having to deal with lots of idiosyncratic data collection activities.

You can see [my sweaty mug over at the dev team page](http://ropensci.org/about/#devteam).  That's a photo right after skinning up the highest mountain in Vermont for some early season tracks on a warm December day (32F!!!)  I'm looking forward to some good development work and getting some projects going.
