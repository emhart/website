Unifying Life-History Analyses for Inference of<br />Fitness and Population Growth<br /><a href="https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B_M0mgmVJAKUYmZjNmQxMTMtODljMy00N2MzLTg1ODEtZWY2NDI5YmIxY2Mw&hl=en"><br />vol. 172, no. 1 the american naturalist july 2008<br /></a><br /><br />I have no paper for yesterday because I was at a conference all day, instead I'm reading a paper that my friend Matt Kaproth sent to me.  I must admit I really didn't give this the read that it deserved.  In it Ruth Shaw and her colleagues provide several examples of using a new set of models they've called "Aster" models to estimate lifetime fitness.  They point out that current models of fitness either ignore the fact that they violate the assumptions of those models (i.e. normality, etc...), or analyze components of fitness individually ignoring the obvious causal dependency between say the juvenile survivorship of a plant and the number of offspring it produces (you can't reproduce if you don't survive).  Aster models allow a researcher to integrate these different life history stages that have different sampling distributions (i.e. binomial and Poisson) into a single model.  They provide an R package that can implement this new method.  Now, I've given a rather crass summary of the paper, but I have to admit my first breeze through this left me wanting to work some examples to understand the method better.  Also much of this literature is "theoretical" to me in the sense that I've read about it, but rarely actually practiced the examples.  Therefore I think I'll have to have some addendums to this post once I begin to understand Aster better.  Until then I think anyone who estimates selection gradients or really does any work with actually measuring selection should check these methods out.</div>

Kudo&#39;s Ted! I&#39;m thinking I&#39;ll pull the Aster models into my final paper on lifetime fitness between plants of native or invasive origins. Ruth Shaw has built up a lot of info on her website: http://www.stat.umn.edu/geyer/aster/</div>
