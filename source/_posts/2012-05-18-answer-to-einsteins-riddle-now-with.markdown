So I came across <a href="http://occamstypewriter.org/vwxynot/2012/05/18/quiz-time-einsteins-logic-problem/">this post by Cath Ennis </a>(@enniscath) about <a href="http://www.naute.com/puzzles/puzzle13.phtml">Einstein's riddle</a>. I had never heard of the riddle, but the apocryphal story that goes with it is that only 2% of people in the world could solve it.  Well, never wanting to miss out on a chance to prove that I'm special, I sat down and decided I should solve it.  Cath did it in 18 minutes.  I didn't time myself, but I'm pretty sure that I didn't do it in less than 18 minutes, I'd peg my time more around 25ish minutes.  It reminded me of doing Soduku.  In any case, here's my answer, you can see that I solved in Power Point of all things.  I find it hard to believe that 98% of people couldn't solve this.  It seemed pretty easy to me, just a lot of variables to keep track of.  I'd reinterpret it as only 2% of people in the world are really nerdy enough to give a shit about logic puzzles.  Here's my solution!  <br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5lN81N4gIcQ/T7bBinj2vrI/AAAAAAAADRc/0yhdiuZkvlY/s1600/Slide1.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-5lN81N4gIcQ/T7bBinj2vrI/AAAAAAAADRc/0yhdiuZkvlY/s400/Slide1.png" width="400" /></a></div><br /></div>

Fun one - Ted your posts are distracting! Good job - beat me by 10 minutes (but I was talking on the phone and a really messy piece of paper)!</div>
