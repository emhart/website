During my ritual 10 am coffee and twitter reading I came across mentions of <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/05/07/151936266/wired-to-run-runners-high-may-have-been-evolutionary-advantage?sc=tw">a Morning Edition story on a paper</a> that recently came out in the Journal of Experimental Biology (JEB) about humans and running. The thrust of the paper is that humans receiving a "runners-high" (actually a stimulation of the endocannabinoid (eCB) receptors) was an adaptative reward for endurance activity. My first thought was that the logic of this is all wrong.  Here's the intro to the NPR story. <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">Endurance athletes sometimes say they're "addicted" to exercise. In fact, scientists have shown that rhythmic, continuous exercise — aerobic exercise — can in fact produce narcotic like chemicals in the body. Now researchers suggest that those chemicals may have helped turn humans, as well as other animals, into long-distance runners. </blockquote><br />At this point feel free to be skeptical.  The phrase is carefully worded to only imply causality, the authors and NPR push the envelope a bit later in the piece.  <br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">"Wired to run, meaning that our brains are probably, have been sort of rewired from an evolutionary sense to encourage these running and high aerobic-activity behaviors," Raichlen says....<br />Meat is one payoff for runners. But Raichlen thinks there may have been another reward: a runner's high. He designed an experiment to test this idea.  </blockquote><br />Now you should be waiting for some elegantly designed experiment to test all this.  The experiment that comes though is really not at all what one might expect.  Essentially the authors took two mammals, dogs and ferrets, and measured levels of eCB's after exercise and did the same with humans.  Dogs and humans are "cursorial" mammals, but ferrets aren't.  Therefore if dogs and humans run for the reward, they are expected to have elevated eCB's.  Low and behold they do.  The chain of causality is that eCB's make us feel good when we run, so we evolved to run, the reward being the runner's high.  Anyone who's read Gould and Lewontin's <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/42062">"Spandrels of San Marco"</a> paper ought to have caught the flaw in the reasoning here (I think its still valid here <a href="http://people.ibest.uidaho.edu/~bree/courses/9_Pigliucci_2000.pdf">despite criticisms</a> of Gould and Lewontin.)  <a href="http://www.jeremybyoder.com/">Jeremy Yoder</a> wrote a great post about how they didn't demonstrate anything to do with evolution at all.  He of course has read <a href="http://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MYk1XbelDssC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=endler+selection+wild&amp;ots=x2laGwRD55&amp;sig=gPCpDq1OEpZop5SGVzG0tQJ426Q&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=endler%20selection%20wild&amp;f=false">Endler's "Measuring selection in the wild"</a> as he astutely points out on his blog: <br /><br /><blockquote class="tr_bq"> To really show that the runner's high is an adaptation, of course, we'd need data that showed (1) observed variation in the runner's high response has a genetic basis, and (2) people who had get stronger runner's highs have more babies.  </blockquote><br>The logic of Raichlen is a bit like saying birds fly <b>because</b> it feels good to be up so high in the sky.  Now birds are a good example of this because <a href="http://www.springerlink.com/content/l8m17n8u4l94u8k0/?MUD=MP">flightlessness has evolved multiple times</a>.  Just because the physiological structures exist that allow a behavior (running, flight) does not mean the organism engages in said behavior <b>because</b> of a trait.  Raichlen says in his conclusion:  <blockquote class="tr_bq"> It is possible that neurobiological rewards induced by eCB signaling are an ancient human trait that evolved to encourage aerobic activity (Bramble and Lieberman, 2004; Carrier, 1984; Malina and Little, 2008), and that the rewards explain the evolution of differences in voluntary locomotor activity more broadly across mammals.   </blockquote>   <br><br>I highly doubt that eCB's "evolved to encourage aerobic" activity.  If we were to engage in "just-so" story telling about this system, you'd say that humans that produced eCB's were more effective at capturing resources and could therefore have more children.  Raichlen doesn't mention reproduction at all. But I'll leave the Endleresque criticism to Jeremy, I have another problem with this study.   <br><br>Raichlen chose just two taxa besides humans. The authors are very open about this, but what they totally neglect is the underlying phylogeny of their taxonomic choices.  According to recent <a href="http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/content/25/9/1795.full">mammalian phylogenies</a>, ferrets and dogs are actually sister taxa.  So I adopted two possible pathways based on what I know about cursorial vs non-cursorial mammals.  We know already that mice have elevated eCB's during exercise.  By the authors own definition, let's assume that sedentary mammals like cows and sheep don't have eCB's.  By examining the tree, it can be seen that eCB stimulation was either <a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-sgPRgbLrfeI/T6hScxIIdnI/AAAAAAAADP4/YsHyRYEj-GI/s1600/AssumeAncestralstate.png" imageanchor="1" style="">lost at least twice</A>, or <a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-H7qFy5UEQ6E/T6hSg8bC_AI/AAAAAAAADQE/xPCB_E-no7w/s1600/NonAncestral.png" imageanchor="1" style="">gained at least three times</a> (red circles are losses and green ones gains).   What would be really interesting is to see where this trait maps across the phylogeny.  Is it a conserved trait that was selected for in some ancestor?  That would point to the fact that maybe it has nothing to do with running. The authors are mute about phylogeny,  but eCB's could alternatively be the ancestral character state, and really the interesting question is why did ferrets evolve the loss of this state? On the other hand maybe the trait evolved multiple times, and that also is really interesting to ask how that happened.  But either phylogenetic scenario undermine the central thesis of Raichlen.  Either it evolved in a common ancestor in which case it may have nothing to do with running.  Or it evolved independently in dogs and humans, meaning that there may have been different selective pressures at work in each species (or the same, we don't really know).  <br><br> Raichlen is an anthropologist and something of a media darling scientist who studies a topic near and dear to many people.  It seems irresponsible that he was able to make so many assertions about evolution with zero evidence for it, and  make assumptions about the conservation of traits across a phylogeny without even mentioning phylogeny.  So what's the role of the media in all of this though?  It's something that was<a href="http://www.ic.arizona.edu/~raichlen/Media.htm"> picked up by lots of media sources</a> saying things like "Yet whether other mammals are also driven to exercise by endocannabinoids has remained a mystery."  <a href="http://www.economist.com/node/21552536">(from the Economist)</a>.  Unfortunately, there's no way to undo that misplaced causality.    <br><br><br><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.jtitle=The+Journal+of+experimental+biology&rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F22442371&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&rft.atitle=Wired+to+run%3A+exercise-induced+endocannabinoid+signaling+in+humans+and+cursorial+mammals+with+implications+for+the+%27runner%27s+high%27.&rft.issn=0022-0949&rft.date=2012&rft.volume=215&rft.issue=Pt+8&rft.spage=1331&rft.epage=6&rft.artnum=&rft.au=Raichlen+DA&rft.au=Foster+AD&rft.au=Gerdeman+GL&rft.au=Seillier+A&rft.au=Giuffrida+A&rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Ecology+%2F+Conservation">Raichlen DA, Foster AD, Gerdeman GL, Seillier A, & Giuffrida A (2012).
