I'd like to say that I've been waiting to give a state of the blog to coincide with the president's state of the union instead of just being "busy", but that's not the case.  In fact I wish I were so "busy", but the truth is that it's less that I've been busy and more that I don't have much to say. If a blog is going to be successful, it relies on people having to a lot of things to say, so it begs the question: "why don't I have much to say?"  So in many ways this post on the state of the blog is more like a "state of me."

There's a saying that goes "it's not where you are, it's where you're at" (A friend told me it was from Mobb Deep, but the original lyrics there is "it ain't where you from it's where you at").  The main point being that no matter where you "are" (geographically, professionally, etc...) what matters most is where you're "at" (mentally, emotionally, spiritually, etc...), because you can never escape yourself.  So I want to take stock of where I (and my blog) both "are" and are "at".



**Where I am**


Right now the blog has been somewhat stagnant, and this is an external reflection of my own internal confusion.  It doesn't generate a huge readership, and that's fine with me.  Here's sort of the laundry list of where I am:

* I am mid-way through my post-doc at UBC.  
* I am working as an instructor for [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org/)
* I am programming with [rOpenSci](http://www.ropensci.org)

Where you are is a relatively simple questions to answer.  Just straightforward statements of fact.  The next part is the hard part


**Where I'm at**

*The blog*

Realistically, the blog will never be a fancy blog with a large readership.  I don't have the personal cachet of the people over at [Dynamic ecology](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/), nor the things to say of a larger collective blog of grad students, something like the great new blog [Biodiverse perspectives](http://www.biodiverseperspectives.com/).  I once asked on twitter: "How big does a blog have to be to be considered successful?"  What I realize now is that I was asking the wrong question. Afterall, that answer only matters if your goal is to be a blogger.  I want to leverage the blog for the next section.

*Me!*

I wonder if there is some pithy advice out there for post-docs.  Like some riff on the old Camus quote: "There is no sun without shadow, and it is essential to know the night.", like "There is no job without shadow, and it is essential to know the post-doc".  I like my post-doc, but I feel that I am standing at the proverbial fork in the road.  I'm still open to academia, but far more open to other opportunities than I was when I started my PhD. Perhaps the biggest dilemma for me is that I am unsure of where I want to go in academia.  If I had to write a research statement, I don't know what it would be about.  (Potential employers the previous line is redacted for you)

What I want to do next matters because I need to devote some serious time to figuring it out and honing my skills. It is more than just a navel contemplation exercise (although no much more). Do I want to stay in academia?  Well I need to really hone in on what I want to do next, find my next big question and read the literature intensively.  Do I want to be a programmer and data scientist?  Well I better make sure my technical skills are up there.  I only have so much time to make myself a desirable candidate.  I think the truth is I would be very happy in academia or in industry, but I'm not totally confident I'm competitive for an academic job when I compare myself to many of my stellar peers. 

So there you have it.  Both where the blog (and myself) are, and are at.  Now that I have had two deeply narcissistic posts, I'll move on to bigger and better things and figure things out!
