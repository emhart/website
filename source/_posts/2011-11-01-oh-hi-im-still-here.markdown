Hi blog world...I haven't left, but my wife has become seriously ill and she and I have been in and out of hospitals the past month, with more to go.  It's sad to have worked hard on the blog, but on the list of boats to keep afloat the blog is not at the top of the list.  <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://aestheticoctopus.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/s_sad_face1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="375" width="500" src="http://aestheticoctopus.files.wordpress.com/2009/10/s_sad_face1.jpg" /></a></div></div>

Our thoughts are with you and your wife.<br /><br />I wouldn&#39;t worry about the blog. Thanks to RSS and email updates, letting them sit quietly for a while is rarely an issue. Some of my favorite blogs post irregularly and only once every few months.</div>
