Since then two interesting papers have come out about natural selection and urban environments.  The first is by Halfwerk et al. from PNAS titled: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11290739/Hong%20and%20Bero-2011.pdf">Low-frequency songs lose their potency in noisy urban conditions</a> and a second one also about birds by Rodewald et al. in Ecology: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11290739/Rodewald%2C%20Shustack%2C%20Jones%20-%20Unknown%20-%20Dynamic%20selective%20environments%20and%20evolutionary%20traps%20in%20human-dominated%20landscapes.pdf">Dynamic selective environments and evolutionary traps in human-dominated landscapes</a>.  Both deal with selective forces that urban environments impose on bird species.  Halfwerk et al. worked with Great Tit's   <span class="right-caption"><img border="0" height="135" width="230" src="http://static.guim.co.uk/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2009/6/2/1243949017945/A-Great-Tit-pauses-on-a-w-002.jpg" />   <p>Tasty bug! </p></span> in the Netherlands.  Birds that rely on communication via songs have always had to deal with how environments alter their songs, <a href="http://www.jstor.org/stable/2460725">dealing with reverberations in different forest types</a> as an example. Halfwerk et al. examined the affects of anthropogenic noise on female preference for males.  Cities typically have low frequency background noise and birds, and in order to cope with this male Great Tit's have change the frequency of their songs to reduce spectral overlap with ambient noise.  Halfwerk and colleagues found that males tend to use low frequency songs right before egg laying and that females show higher fidelity when attracted by low frequency songs.  But in urban environments there is a rapid signal degradation of the low frequency songs, so if males want to be heard by more females they have to use high frequency songs.  The authors argue that this creates a trade-off between natural selection and sexual selection.   There is natural selection they argue for high frequency songs because it maintains a strong signal efficiency in urban environments but sexual selection for low frequency songs due to female preference and fidelity.  In this study the urban birds are worse off because they are more likely to be cuckolded due to the use of high frequency songs, but in Rodewald et al's work on Cardinals in urban environments the opposite is true.    <br> <br> Rodewald et al. examined how urban vs rural environments altered the relationship between plumage coloration and annual reproductive output in the northern Cardinal.  They found that Cardinals in urban environments were had no relationship between annual reproductive output and redness (as measured from photographs) but in rural environments there was a negative relationship between redness and reproductive success.  Cardinals gain most of their coloration from carotenoids and in typical rural environments these are hard to come by so redness becomes a typical sexually selected trait.  Only the strongest cardinals can gain access to the best resources (and carotenoids) and females prefer those cardinals that are the most red.  The catch is that in Ohio, where this study took place, there is a common invasive called Amur Honeysuckle <i>(Lonicera maackii)</i>.  In urban areas this is very common so combined with access to bird food there is no relationship between fitness and redness.  In urban environments then there is relaxed sexual selection for coloration.  The situation is worse though.  In rural environments there is still honeysuckle, but its much more rare and as a consequence the fittest males gain access to it.    <span class="left-caption"><img border="0" height="135" width="230" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_oBvdfIieHZ0/RyNNnTkfKnI/AAAAAAAACSk/yORUw214dWU/s400/IMG_2101.jpg" />   <p>Red makes me strong!</p></span>But its what Rodewald calls an "evolutionary trap".  Males will choose to nest in it, but its lower to the ground and nests in the honeysuckle are more likely to be preyed upon, especially early in the breeding season.  Therefore in rural environments, redness is actually correlated with reduced number of successful reproductions in males.  So in this Cardinal system in Ohio, urban birds have an easier time because everybody can be red.  One thing that's unclear to me from the study was that I thought if nesting in the invasive honeysuckle causes reduced number of offspring in rural environments, how come urban males don't have the same problem?  Regardless of this question though, both studies show how anrthopogenic forces can alter established sexually selective relationships.  In the case of the Great Tit's, it was forcing males to change their song to a less desirable one, and in the case of the Cardinal urban environments let every male appear to be a good mate choice.    <br><br>  Both studies offer evidence of how urbanization changes the fitness landscapes for organisms.  There isn't necessarily anything very novel about this in and of itself, in fact just look at pigeons or house sparrows as examples of birds and urbanization.  What's really interesting about both studies is that they show the wide variety of complex interactions that happen with specific facets of urbanization that we rarely consider changing that fitness landscape.  What remains to be seen in both systems is what is the eventual upshot of these altered relationships.  Will new sexually selective relationships evolve in each species such that there becomes a high degree of "local adaptation" for mating preferences in urban and rural birds?  That could be something interesting to study in the future.  What are new selective relationships?  We can all see the old ones becoming less important because we already know what they are.  For instance in the Great Tit its not that females actually prefer high frequency singing males, its just that those are the ones they can find.  In fact Halfwerk points out that male-male communication usually uses songs in that frequency range, so will urban environments change bird communication completely then?  It would be interesting to see someone make specific predictions about what they expect to see these new relationships would be and to go out and test them.     <br><br><i><b>References</i></b><br><br><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.jtitle=Proceedings+of+the+National+Academy+of+Sciences+of+the+United+States+of+America&rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F21876157&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&rft.atitle=Low-frequency+songs+lose+their+potency+in+noisy+urban+conditions.&rft.issn=0027-8424&rft.date=2011&rft.volume=108&rft.issue=35&rft.spage=14549&rft.epage=54&rft.artnum=&rft.au=Halfwerk+W&rft.au=Bot+S&rft.au=Buikx+J&rft.au=van+der+Velde+M&rft.au=Komdeur+J&rft.au=Ten+Cate+C&rft.au=Slabbekoorn+H&rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Ecology+%2F+Conservation">Halfwerk W, Bot S, Buikx J, van der Velde M, Komdeur J, Ten Cate C, & Slabbekoorn H (2011).
