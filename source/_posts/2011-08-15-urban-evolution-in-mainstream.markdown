Urban ecology and evolution has always been one of those things that fascinates me but that I've never really had much experience with.  As a native of rural Vermont, my exposure to nature has always been what you would call "traditional New England".  Boyhood swims in the creek flipping over rocks to look for salamanders, hikes through the woods where my dad taught me all the different tree species (This was important since we heated our house with wood we logged ourselves so I would need to know this to understand what trees to cut down because they provided the most heat).  A nice article has appeared in the New York Times science section on <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/26/science/26evolve.html?_r=1&scp=3&sq=urban%20ecology&st=cse" targen="_blank">evolution in urban environments</a>.  The article cover lots of ground.  It discusses work by Jason Munshi-South on<a href="http://faculty.baruch.cuny.edu/jmunshi-south/documents/MunshiSouth.2010.MEC.Pleucopus.Structure.pdf"> population structuring on white-footed mice</a> caused by population isolation due to urbanization.  This is at neutral loci, so of course its an open question as to how adapted these populations have become to urban life.
<br />
<br />In the next study the article takes on is one of my favorites.  It basically finds the<a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&pid=explorer&chrome=true&srcid=0B_M0mgmVJAKUYjlmYTBjYmQtMWMwNC00ZjFlLTgyMWQtMTkxYjVjMzNmODUy&hl=en_US"> genetic basis and mechanism for PCB resistance</a> in Hudson river Tomcod.  This work by Isaac Wirgin at NYU and collaborators is really fascinating.  The Hudson river had<a href="http://www.clearwater.org/pcbs/slideshow/slide1.html"> PCB's dumped </a>into it from 1947 - 1976.  Wirgin screened fish populations all up and down the east coast, up to the maritime provences of Canada.  He used a gene that is well known to cause the toxicity of PCB's in animals, AHR.  Essentially this gene regulates the methylation of xenobiotic enzymes, and these are toxic themselves.  The researchers found two variants of this gene, one that is normal in non-polluted sites north of the Hudson, and one that is 100x less sensitive to PCB's around the Hudson. They also look at haplotype diversity and find no evidence of a genetic bottleneck and also see reproductive isolation between the southern (Hudson river and south) and the northern estruarine populations.  This evolution must have been quite rapid, less than 60 years obviously.  They end the article saying that selection most likely acted via embryonic mortality and deformations and that there is most likely a cost to this decreased sensitivity.  The article continues to touch on other topics like the evolution of bacterial resistance in urban hospitals, ant communities on road medians in Brooklyn and invasive species such as Oriental bittersweet. I think there are two corollaries to this article.  
<br />
<br />The first is that its great to see the idea that humans are part of nature, not different from nature.  I think too often the general public draws this distinction between nature (i.e. forest, jungle, ocean) and us (cities, farms, etc..).  So an article pointing out that cities are nature, just a new kind of nature (and by nature here I'm referring mostly to the abiotic environment), is great I think.  How are road medians any different than small islands?  If you're an ant they aren't that different.  So I've enjoyed seeing that.  The second is a point that I'm sure was hit home hard at ESA (I wish I could have made it) this year, and has been on the rise in the ecological literature of late; that is the intersection of ecology and evolution.  Imagine an ecologist who hypothesizes that tomcod abundance will be lower in impacted environments vs pristine environments, and uses the Hudson river estruary as an impacted site.  He/She goes out and takes abundance measurements and concludes there is no difference (this is obviously a very simple design for the purposes of our thought experiment), toxins are A-OK.  This inference we know is false because of the previous study, and our current experiment is predicated that ecological and evolutionary time scales are different.   But our experiment is not robust to this assumption.  So what are we to do as ecologists?  That's something I don't have an easy answer to.  Being cognizant of it is start though.  Perhaps something to tackle in some future posts.  </div>

Thanks for the link to the article.  I took a look and it does seem very similar.  I think there are two possible routes you could take in the future.  One would be to look at strength response of selection along a continuum of human use (natural area, rural area, suburb, city) and see the strength of the response to selection a function of the strength of the selective force? Another possibility would be to look at trade-offs in urban environments, and how strong those trade-offs are in relation to rates of urbanization.</div>

I read a nice article about the evolution of a small plant in urban environment http://www.pnas.org/content/105/10/3796.long<br /><br />I suspect that microevolution in towns is not so widespread, but we have just begun to consider it and perhaps I am wrong</div>
