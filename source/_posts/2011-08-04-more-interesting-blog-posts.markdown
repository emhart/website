I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://andrewgelman.com/" target="_blank">Andrew Gelman's blog</a>, and he's got an interesting post about<a href="http://andrewgelman.com/2011/07/one_of_the_easi/" target="_blank"> "One of the easiest ways to differentiate an economist from almost anyone else"</a>  It's an interesting post because it involves applying Russell's paradox to some statements made my economists in a rather humorous way.  Its good for a laugh.</div>
