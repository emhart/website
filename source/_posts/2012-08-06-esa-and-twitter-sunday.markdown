In 2007 at ESA I and two other people were using twitter.  Back then I didn't understand it and had to ask what hashtags were.  I gave up on twitter until 2010 and now with a new handle I think I finally get it.  One of my favorite things to do with twitter is text mine it.  So here's a word cloud of the 745 tweets with the #ESA2012 tag from Sunday. Clearly Jane Lubchenco and the plenary sessions were on lots of people's minds. <!-- more -->

We can also check out who tweeted the most.  I could make a figure of this, but
I don't have time at the moment so here's a quick and dirty table.  You can check out [the code I used to do this as gist on my github](https://gist.github.com/3272216).
