I don't really see much comment action on my blog, and when I went to comment on it myself I got a glimpse into a possible reason.  Of course given my massive readership and witty prose, I immediately discounted the fact it just might possibly be that not very many people read my blog and find it interesting enough to comment on.  Now that I successfully falsified the two simplest hypotheses, I began my search for the more nuanced answer.  I  came to the realization that blogger's comment system is as efficient at commenting as an elderly woman is at paying for that one item at the express lane in the grocery store with a check at the register thats being run by a teenager who only knows about checks from movies they used to watch out of their parent VHS collection.  So I installed Disqus.  Now all I need to sit back and watch those comments fly in.  Also if anyone was looking at the blog this morning it may have seemed like some sort of theme short circuit happened as I tried mucking with the CSS  and HTML to add some custom "reply to comments" code but it didn't work.</div>

Thanks for this Ted. Blogger commenting is maddening, especially for those of us who don&#39;t use Blogger.</div>

I only discovered your blog recently, haven&#39;t had time to dig through your old posts, and managed to miss the post on Ecolog&#39;s exponential growth. So, although I&#39;m just the sort of outlier you dread when you have a sample size of one, I thought I&#39;d say hello.</div>
