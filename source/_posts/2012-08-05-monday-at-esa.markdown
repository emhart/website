So Monday marks the opening of ESA 2012 in Portland.  I'm up late trying to simultaneously prepare for a camping trip after the conference and the conference.  I wanted to at least get down my initial choices for Monday.  My hope is to blog every night about the conference, including highlights of a given day, and then plans for the next.  I've done different strategies over the years at ESA.  Some years I've just chosen sessions and just sat through every talk, and others I've only gone to talks I want to.  So here's a run down of what I'm hoping to catch tomorrow.  Also Jeremy Fox over at Dynamic Ecology has his picks up too and they look great.  [Check them out](http://dynamicecology.wordpress.com/)

These are only the talks I'm most excited about.  I had a hard time narrowing down my schedule to just these, there were way more talks that I wanted to see but they were in concurrent sessions.  See you all Monday!
