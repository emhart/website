Another year, another ESA. A week after it ended and I feel like I've just recovered.  This marks my 5th ESA, and each one has been different.  In years past I'd say that I've mostly been inspired upon leaving them.  This year though I walked away and didn't feel like I saw any great talks.  This isn't to say that I thought all the talks were bad, only I didn't see anything that left me inspired like in the past.  I still had a great conference though, just for reasons different from previous years. <!-- more -->

<b> What wasn't the best...</b>
<br><br>
I'll just come out and say it.  I don't like the 15 minute talk.  First it's really hard to do well.  You've got to be a good story teller, and have a talk that can be easily interpretable without getting bogged down in methods.  My old advisor Nick Gotelli is especially good at this.  The issue is that methods are often what is really interesting and necessary to fully understand the results of a talk.  A great example of this in my mind was a <a href="http://eco.confex.com/eco/2012/webprogram/Paper38797.html" target="_blank">talk by Annette Ostling</a>.  I enjoyed her talk, and I've read a few papers on stochastic niche modeling, but it's hardly a literature I'm familiar with.  I left her talk wishing it was longer and she could have covered the methods and theory a bit more slowly.  But when you've got a complicated topic, you either have to cruise through methods to get to results or not show that much in the results.  This leads to my next issue.  There's just too many talks.  This ESA had rooms located on different ends of the convention center, so if you wanted to see at talk in A101 and another in F101, you couldn't possibly make it.  I'd be happier to see fewer talks get accepted with a longer format.  Or maybe a mix of shorter form graduate student post-doc talks and longer form "Famous person talks".

One of the things I saw was that well known scientists would sometimes give talks in rooms meant for 40 people, and the room was overflowing with a huge spill out crowd.  I on the other hand gave a talk in a ballroom to 30 or so people that could easily hold 200 people.  I realize the problem with this is that someone has to say: "you're famous, you're not" and that can bruise egos and foster nepotism.  And one of the things that I like about ESA is that it isn't completely nepotistic.  A first year grad student could give a talk after E.O. Wilson in the same COS.  All the same though, I'd rather give a short talk in a small room and have the chance to see someone like Annette give a 30 minute talk in a large room that wasn't overflowing.  The meeting has gotten bigger and bigger, and I don't know if it's a bad idea to reconsider its format.  Ok, but enough of what wasn't that great, I'll move on to what was.


**What was the best**


The people.  That's the short answer.  It was great to see all my old friends; to be rushing from one talk to another and then completely miss it because I become engrossed in conversation.  Eating late dinners and drinking all night with old friends is one of my favorite things about ESA.  So the best part was the people I already knew, and the next best thing was a chance to meet new people.  This is especially great because of twitter.  I was able to meet various people I knew on twitter in real life.  These are the connections that allow you to form collaborations (which I did) and make new friends (This too!).  The best session I saw overall was the 21st century session organized by [Stephanie Hampton](http://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/~hampton/Site/Stephanie_E._Hampton.html).  It covered issues of big data, social media, and just how to make a better talk.  This gets back to my point about the 15 minute talk.  Maybe we don't need to change the time spot, but change the way we as presenters give our talks, moving away from the standard format we'd use for an hour long talk just compressed to 15 minutes.  

So while I didn't leave feeling inspired with new brilliant research topics, I left feeling inspired about 21st century ecology.  More and more I'm interested in how I can contribute to the movement of open science, data sharing and collaboration, and developing the computational tools to these resources.  I think one of the best things that happened at the meeting was to leave as new member of the [rOpenSci](http://ropensci.org/) development team. So all in all it was a really good meeting for me, I'll have to think about how to revise my own talk style and how I can help develop open science tools and hopefully have something exciting for next year.  See you all in the twitterverse or at #ESA2013.
