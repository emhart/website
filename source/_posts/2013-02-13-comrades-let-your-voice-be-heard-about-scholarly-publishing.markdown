When I was in college I had a girlfriend who's dad was an ex-lawyer turned self-proclaimed anarchist scholar.  She left me for a guy in his late 30's who worked in a scarf store, and I was stuck with a stack of anarchist theory books I'd bought to try and impress her at the local used bookstore. <img style="float:right" src="http://www.iwise.com/authorIcons/9555/Peter%20Kropotkin_128x128.png" />  while my politics have mellowed a bit in most things, my opninion on scholarly publishing is about in line with what [Kropotkin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Kropotkin) would have made of the situation if he were around today. I got a chance to air my radical views thanks to the wonderful [Jarrett Byrnes](http://www.jarrettbyrnes.info/) and his NCEAS colleagues.  He is working on a survey, where you can speak your mind and channel Kropotkin, or Karl Rove, or anyone in between.  No matter what the most important thing is that you take the survey!  So here's [the link to the survey](http://bit.ly/eebpublishing) and you can read more about [their NCEAS group here.](http://openpub.nceas.ucsb.edu/2013/01/24/surveying-opinions-on-scholarly-publishing-in-eeb/)
