			<div class = "span6">Distributed ecology has been around in one form or another since 2010. Originally I intended it as a forum for myself and my friends in grad school to discuss different manuscripts without the committment of a journal club. Like most journal clubs it quickly fell apart.  I let the blog languish for a year and then revitalized it about a year ago.  I kept with the original spirit, trying to write detailed posts about different papers I found interesting.  Recently as my interests have become more and more computational, the blog has reflected that with many recent posts devoted to ecological methods in R and Python. It's my hope to continue using the blog as a forum to discuss new ideas in ecology, computational methods in ecology, and trends in open science.  </div>
