I don't really publish much these days (or ever for that matter if I'm being honest, after all there's a reason I don't have a TT job).  That said, I still have lingering science projects.  Some left over from my dissertation, some are ideas that I'd like to publish with existing data.  In fact this seems like an obvious use case as more and more data becomes available.  Especially when we consider what the typical career path of a PhD student will look like.

There's this figure pulled from the [2012 NIH Workforce report](http://report.nih.gov/investigators_and_trainees/acd_bwf/) that has been circulating for quite some time.

The take home is that a majority of people without academic jobs who hold PhD's, and if they have work they want to publish, where can they do so?  Obviously traditional journals are a venue.  However my own opinion is that I never want to publish there again.  As someone who has self-selected out the academic career path, I have no use for the prestige of a journal and since I still do scientific work outside of a traditional academic setting, I don't have access to non-OA articles. Because I have some work I'd like to publish, I got to thinking where I'd like to send it.  A cursory look at the [costs of publishing in OA journals](http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/scholarlycommunication/oa_fees.html) shows that most are between $1,000 and $2000.  Not an insignificant cost if I'm just a 9-5er paying out of pocket.
