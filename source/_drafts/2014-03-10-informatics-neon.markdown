File this under things you don't want to admit about your job.  My job title at [NEON](http://www.neoninc.org) is "Eco-informaticist", and when I saw the job description I thought "I can do that!", but really had no idea what informatics was.  I like to imagine this isn't totally my fault, if you were to ask Google: "[what is informatics](https://www.google.com/search?q=what+is+informatics)" you'll get a woefully tautological answer of "information science".
