## emhart.info

This is the source code to my person site [emhart.info](http://emhart.info), and it's powered by [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).  Octopress is a [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) powered static blogging framework.  The site is probably best served as an example because it's full of niggly little poorly document CSS changes that I made, and hand edited SVG icons.  But if you can make it work, enjoy, it's your's for the taking!
