<br />We are hiring a professor in insect systematics here at UVM. On top of UVM being a great university to work at Burlington is an amazing and special place to live. In fact I'm about to pack it in and go jump on my sailboat on this beautiful windy August day.If it were winter I'd be getting up earlier on Saturday than I ever do during the week to skin up the mountain to get some fresh tracks.
<br />
<br />So what are you waiting for insect systematists?

<br /><b> Update </b>
<br />Another reason to consider UVM and Burlington, this rainbow over the lake as I went for my lakeside run down the city bikepath.
