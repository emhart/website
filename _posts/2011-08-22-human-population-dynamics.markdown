One of my least favorite questions I get asked as an ecologist is: "Why does this matter?".  I won't let myself get sucked into too much of a diatribe, but I always turn into a curmudgeonly old scientist when I hear this.  The unspoken assumption is that only things that apply human welfare "matter".  <a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oQCJbPLRWFs/TilvCcEKwaI/AAAAAAAAAKk/L4GhFpDhQ1E/s1600/Crowd.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 180px; height: 107px;" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-oQCJbPLRWFs/TilvCcEKwaI/AAAAAAAAAKk/L4GhFpDhQ1E/s1600/Crowd.jpg" border="0" alt="" /></a>So it was with great interest that I read Alan Berryman and Maurcio Lima's newest paper in Oikos: <a href="http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11290739/Lima_Berryman-2011.pdf">"Positive and negative feedbacks in human population dynamics: future equilibrium or collapse?"</a>  They essentially make the point that we can apply the tools of traditional population dynamic analysis to human population data to look for different feedbacks both positive and negative. 
<br />
<br />In this paper they rely on the R function which is (N is the population size):<center>
<br /><a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=R=log_{e} N_{t}-log_{e}N_{t-d}" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?R=log_{e} N_{t}-log_{e}N_{t-d}" title="R=log_{e} N_{t}-log_{e}N_{t-d}" /></a></center>
<br />It defines the population rate of change over some census period <i>d</i> which is usually 5 years.  If you've ever read any other papers by these guys, or any of Berryman's books, this will be very familiar.  They then go through and identify different periods of positive growth (cooperation) and negative growth (density dependence) with population size and try and relate those to different periods of human history.  They also look at the rates of change for the rates of change to see how rapid changes in growth rate happened (a 2nd derivative of sorts).  They then take a special interest the last 45 years for a variety of different specific populations such as sub-Saharan Africa, Japan, China, India, the US and fit generalize additive models (GAM) to them.  Finally they use partial least squares (PLS) regression to fit composite variables to growth rates to see what correlates with recent rates of change, things such as fresh water, arable land, GDP, food production etc.

<br />What's particularly interesting is that they see such a strong signal above. These are simple plots of growth rate vs population size and for global population size you can see a strong density dependence and a strong cooperation pattern in up until the  middle ages and then again from the Enlightenment through the industrial revolution.  Apparently there wasn't enough data from the late middle ages to fit a model just to that period but it does show an expected negative trend they associate with the little ice age and the black plague.  They argue that the 2nd positive feedback (1700-1960) is sort of an Allee effect where cooperation leads to a positive relationship between population size and growth rate.   The GAM results show that sub-Saharan Africa has a hump shaped relationship with population size showing a shift from cooperative behavior to negative density dependence over the past 45 years but is negative for all other populations.  Their PLS results show that economic factors tend to be negatively correlated with population growth rates, but positively with measures of resources.  This all begs two main questions. Does technology facilitate population growth (the enlightenment through industrial revolution) and why do we see a decline now and is that decline a sign of a stable equilibrium point?  If you've got any experience with population dynamic models, you'll know that a single time lag model of negative density dependence will lead to a single non-trivial equilibrium point. They don't really answer them but end ambiguously, saying that the recent logistic growth that they observe does not necessitate that we are reaching an equilibrium as a species.  Instead they note that as we deplete resources we could observe a 2nd order or higher feedback that could cause the human population to crash.  
<br />
<br />I have to say I was surprised to see we are in a period of density dependent growth. I doubt this paper will get any popular press, but I found it interesting example of ecological methods applied to human populations. I thought the GAM portion didn't elucidate much but otherwise a very interesting read. Its not the only time this has been done, you can see some work done by <a href="http://www.eeb.uconn.edu/people/turchin/PDF/RevSEC.pdf">Peter Turchin on the same subject.</a>  Perhaps one of the greatest problems with tackling this topic is the question of scale.  If I'm interested in the dynamics of mice in Sonoran desert, I can make certain "global" assumptions about rainfall, resources, etc...that make up the entire habitat of my study population.  But human populations are all over the globe and you could easily have a disaster in one part of the world that doesn't necessarily show a signal in this level analysis.  A tsunami in Japan doesn't necessarily impact population growth in the US.  Although thats not always the case.  Another component for humans is the globalization of energy and food markets. As we become a more interconnected human population, a disaster in some place like the middle east could truly disrupt population growth in the US through increases in food prices.  A final thought is that ecological models assume that all individuals want to maximize their reproduction and don't because of some resource limitation.  Human beings on the other hand  have complex psychological/sociological reasons for not having children, so a couple may have the resources to reproduce but opt not to.  In part Berryman and Lima get at this with their PLS analysis, but it is an underlying assumption of their model that can be violated by people.
