So I just spent the past 6.5 hours programming a macro for a friend in Excel.  She was tasked by her advisor to take copious amounts of abundance data and convert it to presence absence data at different distances from a focal point.  The problem was two fold.  1).  The distance from the focal point changed with every data sheet and 2). The sheets were entered by people using no standard template.  Instead they were haphazardly entered following data sheets exactly, but those sheets changed year to year.  One thing I learned some time ago was that good field data sheets make awful electronic datasheet formats.  Really given how much data they had it was clear what they really needed was an Access database.  I spent my time helping a friend because those few hours of my time probably saved her 30 - 50 hours of had formatting in excel.  But I was amazed that a senior researcher had let their research program turn to such a mess.  Its a good lesson that I think is worth it for all researchers.  <br /><br />I think as academics we are sort of one person shows.  We have to program our analyses, manage our own data, run the whole shop.  If you're not good at those things, you can waste vast amounts of time.  This lab had spent countless hours and who knows how much money paying grad students to waste their time curating data by hand into a format that then had to be reformatted again by hand.  I'm hardly a proficient programmer in VBA, but even a brute force attempt can save weeks worth of labor.  By being organized with your data you can be far more productive over time.</div>
