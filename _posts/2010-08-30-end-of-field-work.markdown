Its a particularly monumental conclusion because its the end of 3 years of work, and my last trip out there will be in a few weeks to destroy the sites.  But now that I'm no longer in the field, I'm excited to get back to writing, and move those several manuscripts in the pipeline out into the wider world.  My other focus is landing a post-doc. I found that in the middle of my PhD I had a sort of tunnel vision because I was focused exclusively on my project and all things that pertained to it.  Whats really exciting (read also as scary) about a post-doc is that I can change directions, and move to explore new aspects of ecology.  My main interests as I look to the future are in no particular order: metacommunities / spatial coexistence mechanisms, modeling and computational methods, macroecology, food-webs / network theory applied to ecology.  <br /><br />While I know I lack expertise in some of these subjects, they still broadly interest me and I think what unifies them is that they all can provide insight into community ecology using modern computational methods.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jcnUEp-t9Nw/THv6W1VJzNI/AAAAAAAACaU/92XMK87WOZA/s1600/Slide1.JPG"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_jcnUEp-t9Nw/THv6W1VJzNI/AAAAAAAACaU/92XMK87WOZA/s320/Slide1.JPG" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5511273839197801682" /></a>Thats what gets to the heart of what I'm interested in all of these different areas.  I want to use advanced computational methods (agent based models, network theory etc...) to make generalized predictions about ecology and then test those predictions with field data or experiments.  I think that modern computational methods provide a way to take large complex data sets and problems and synthesize them in ways that simpler analytical expressions can't do.  Things like agent based models allow us to take qualitative descriptions and theories and then simulate quantifiable output and test parameter sensitivity and assumptions.  I think that what I'm truly interested in using this paradigm (which is the rather simplified flow chart image) to answer a wide variety of ecological questions that pique my interest.</div>
