*This post is inspired by [Jeremy Yoder's](http://www.denimandtweed.com/) post on the [Molecular Ecology](http://www.molecularecologist.com/) blog on ["Knowing what I know now"](http://www.molecularecologist.com/2012/11/knowing-what-i-know-now-grad-school-jeremy-yoder/) advice for graduate students.  He opened it up as a carnival so I wrote this little gem with my own advice for graduate students.  Fair warning, I will not be winning any awards for "positive person of the year award" so take this all with a grain of salt. And potential employers, please stop reading here*

**Get out while you still can:**  Seriously, that's what any sane rational person would do.  You're giving up probably 8+ years of earnings potential (Phd and post-doc).  Let's consider a simple case.  You decide instead of academia you'll take that brilliant mind of yours and study something more profitable, like engineering or business.  Now at 23 you get a good job and over those 8 years, you manage to sock away $10,000 a year, and invest in a fund that has the minimal annual return rate of 5%.  At the end of those 8 years, say around 31-32, you will have around $100k+. What does the scenario look like after grad school and some post-docing?  My guess would be debt, a used car and a shitty apartment (I don't have a shitty apartment for the record).  Because when you're 25 putting a trip to Hawai'i on a credit card and sleeping on the beach sounds like great fun, but at 32 you're sort of a loser doing that.  So why on earth would you go to graduate school, giving up your prime earning years, to spend 8 years training for a job that pays the same salary as an entry level engineering job?  Does this sound like the choice of a rational person?



**You are a zealot, or you better be:** Want to know the answer to my last question?  It's no.  You are a disciple, an acolyte, you're really no different than a Mormon but without the benefit of an excuse to wear long johns all the time.  So you better fucking believe in what you do and love it.  If you're an unhappy grad student, you're an idiot, at least you should be rich and unhappy, but poor and unhappy is the worst.  So I hope whatever you do, it burns in you so hot that you can only wear natural fibers because your polyester shirts have that awful burning plastic smell to them.  

**Turn into an elephant:** I hear they have really thick skin, and you'll need it.  As a graduate student your normative experience is most likely going to be failure.  You will have many grants rejected, many papers rejected, and essentially have the world shit on you.  As scientists we're trained to skeptical people so we're always questioning, always looking for ways things won't work.  In lab meetings, casual conversations in the hall, people will question your ideas and cut you down.  Sometimes politely, sometimes not.  So learn to be tough.  And if you're going to cry know that no one cares and really it just makes everything awkward so avoid it at all costs.  The ability to stay positive in the darkest of times is a true hallmark of successful people.  If that doesn't work, lick your emotional wounds by cutting down others just like they've done to you! (That is not a serious piece of advice if you're reading anything I've ever done, otherwise go for it.)

**Learn all the drink specials:**  First off you're poor, so you can't afford anything else.  Secondly, after you've spent all day being ripped a new one, you'll need alcohol, as Homer Simpson put it: "Alcohol the...solution to all of life's problems"  (the omitted part of the quote is "cause of and" but let's overlook that).  You'll also want the friends outside of grad school so you can talk shit about your cohort but still maintain professional contact with them, even if you think they're an idiot (which they probably are, they're in grad school after all) they might give you a job one day.

**Be good at something that is actually employable:**  I don't mean have a hobby like reenacting civil war battles with legos.  I mean something that you could put on a resume, so when you don't get that tenure track job that 800 other people applied to and you have to get a real job you might get hired.  Every conversation I have about the academic job market goes something like this: 
someone: "Did you hear about how job X had Y-hundreds of applicants?"
me: "I sure am glad I've got a couple more years of post-doc funding."
But you should be realistic about your prospects.  Academia is a world of positive feedback loops.  The more successful you are, the more successful you'll become.  Therefore PI's are incentivized to publish as much as possible to get ever fewer grants (NSF DEB funding rates are 11% and probably going down).  What's the best way to get more publications?  Hire armies of graduate students.  PI's already have jobs, so if they over train students, what difference does it make?  They get all the benefit, without having to compete with the legions of underlings they've created.  So realize you're a product of a system that rewards those who have already succeeded, and your own success is ultimately inconsequential to  your PI.  They may have kind words otherwise, but ask them if they'll switch places with you and see what they say.  Just tell them Lindsay Lohan and Jamie Lee Curtis thought it was a hoot! The reality is your chances of getting a job in academia when you are finished are not so hot.  So make sure you have something to fall back on.

**That's all folks!:** At this point you might be thinking: "Jesus christ what is wrong with this guy?  He's so cynical."  But really I'm not, I just think you should go into it with your eyes open.  As a graduate student you're no different than a waitress who dreams of being an actress, but you make less money.  Going from grad student to successful academic is most likely harder than anyone has told you, so you should have your eyes wide open.  Before you start, know that you're jumping into a super competive world where 700 people apply for jobs, and grant funding rates are abysmally low.  Know that you'll work long hours for almost no money for 5 or more years and that people will ask you what you do at dinner parties and possibly be impressed, but most likely walk away.  "Oh wow, you study fern phylogenetics?  I think I saw someone I know over there.".  People say dumb shit like: "Grad school is like a marathon, not a sprint." No, it's not like either of those.  It's like a radio contest where you have to keep your hand on the truck the longest and end up shitting your pants.  It's a test of your ability to suffer for what you love.
