Before I start my main post I'd like to thank Ethan White over at  <a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/" target="_blank">Jabberwocky Ecology</a> for the shout out and inspiration to blog about ecology in general.   Ethan's blog was the first one I really read, and gave me a sense of the potential of blogs.</div>
