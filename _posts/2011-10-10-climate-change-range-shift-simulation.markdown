The first is by Early and Sax called: <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01681.x/abstract">Analysis of climate paths reveals potential limitations on species range shifts.</a> and was<a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v478/n7367/full/478009a.html?WT.ec_id=NATURE-20111006"> highlighted by Nature.</a>  The next article was by Sheldon et al, also in the early online section titled:  <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01689.x/abstract">Climate change and community disassembly: impacts of warming on tropical and temperate montane community structure</a>.  Both papers focus on range shifts and both would <a href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com/2011/07/empirical-divide.html">qualify as "3M"</a> as they use collections of published data and simulation models.  Full disclosure as well I did my dissertation on climate change and I currently am a post-doc who only does individual based and simulation modeling.    I really enjoyed Early and Sax's paper because it used simulation to develop a novel point that would be difficult to demonstrate empirically.  Its long been known that species ranges will shift as climate changes and we can use what are called bioclimate envelope models to make predictions about where species will go.  These models essentially say that where a species is now is a good indicator of the climate 'envelope' that it can survive in and it will move geographically to follow that envelope.   Early and Sax ask, if you're a salamander in California, and suddenly Oregon starts looking pretty good thermally speaking in 2075, can you get there?  The short answer is most likely "No".  Not because of physical barriers but because of climate barriers.  This is because as Oregon gets gradually warmer, it will also have cold years too.  So while a salamander can survive the range of temperatures in California, as climate change happens in Oregon only some of those years will be within the range of temperatures our intrepid salamanders want to live in.  So if you have a favorable climate patch in Oregon, but only a narrow corridor to get to it, just because future climate models predict that a lizard could get there doesn't mean it will.  Of course many people have pointed out the link between dispersal rates and distance and actualized range shifts.  The novelty of Early and Sax's work is that they point to the importance of a species ability to persist in unfavorable edge habitats. <a href = "http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WKL39fPSOIw/To9nCIZJhHI/AAAAAAAAC3c/I3V1zToyd6U/s1600/EarlFig1.png"><span class="left-caption"> <img src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WKL39fPSOIw/To9nCIZJhHI/AAAAAAAAC3c/I3V1zToyd6U/s1600/EarlFig1.png" width=284 height=415 /> <p>Potential habitat and habitat that can actually be reached</p> </span></a><br><br>They make a compelling case that just because a habitat will become suitable based on a bioclimate envelope model doesn't mean that the the species can make it there.  The first factor affecting persistence is going to be climate variability in movement corridors.   Furthermore they point out that persistence be impacted by other things. For instance competitors and predators of a given focal species are also on the move and depending on how well they can track a shifting climate.   Obviously if you're a manager planning for climate change, you'll need to consider how best to make sure that species of conservation importance can best make it through these corridors.  One problem with this work that it relies on bioclimate envelope models which have been criticized for the past decade or so (i.e. <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1046/j.1466-822X.2003.00042.x/full">Pearson and Dawson 2003</a>).  The authors actually go to great lengths to justify their use of envelope models, and I can't fault them too much. I wouldn't hang too much on these kinds of models either, but I think they work fine for the authors purposes.  Actually the unmentioned corollary of this work is biotic interactions and priority effects (i.e. <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/104/44/17430.short">Chase 2007</a>).  As lots of different species are moving from place to place, the new communities that are assembled in these new ranges could be different than the originating communities.  Community assembly under climate change could be a fruitful thing to look at in conjunction with bioclimate envelope models and range shifts.  This brings me to the next paper using simulation to look at climate change because it focuses on community disassembly. <br><br> This is work by Sheldon et al. is an example of a simulation paper that I thought wasn't particularly interesting.  Feel free to turn that criticism right around on me because she has a paper in Ecol. Letters and I don't have any. Pressing forward though.  The premise of the paper is straightforward.  There will be more warming in northern latitudes, so you expect a greater amount of community disassembly.  Back up for a moment our author tells us.  Tropical species have much narrower thermal ranges therefore even though there's greater change in the far north, there may be a bigger impact in the tropics.  To get at this they use already published transects of a variety of species (n = 53) that spanned 90 degrees of latitude, 45 in each direction.  They then created a simulation to examine how montane communities disassemble with changing temperature.   <span class="right-caption"><img src="http://www.nature-escapes-kuala-lumpur.com/image-files/jungle-montane-lg.jpg" width=250 height=150 /><p>Kuala Lumpur montane forest</p> </span>In this case a community is a published mountain transect. The simulation uses variety of dispersal mechanisms that allow species individually to move up (or down but mostly up) a mountain.  Some species have higher dispersal capacity and can make it to these new elevations that are within their thermal tolerance.  Others won't be able to disperse or their range will "move off" the mountain because the mountain is too small.  In short Sheldon et al. found that montane communities in the tropics were actually more sensitive to temperature changes compared to temperate communities, e.g. there was more community disassembly.  This I do think is an interesting result theoretical result, but I don't find it compelling on its own.  I would have been much more convinced if the authors had included some actual data to compare their model to.   My problem with this is that its really just recapitulating what we already know.  Its a well known truism that species will have individualistic reactions to climate change, causing novel community assembly (and disassembly in this case).  This idea has been around for at least 20 years.  I think the important question is the follow up: "What does community assembly and disassembly mean in this brave new climate world?".  Ok, so we already know that community disassembly is happening (before this paper), so what are the implications of this?  If community disassembly is happening faster in the tropics what will this mean for tropical vs temperate communities?  I wanted either further simulation or some real data.  I was left feeling that lots of work went into this simulation but the project was only half finished.  I don't like to criticize other people's work too much <a href="http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/09/07/another-legacy-of-nceas-overly-nice-ecologists/">(a problem of ecologists being too nice?</a>), but again it seems like the authors went to great length to demonstrate something with a simulation that I don't think was that novel relative to the Early and Sax paper.  <br><br><br>Let me restate my disclosure of earlier, I am in a post-doc that is all modeling and simulation.  One of things that haunts me is the thought that: "I'm just making shit up".  Ok, its grounded in actual data and theory, but I'm nonetheless plagued by the dangers of circularity.  I can program a simulation to mimic a pattern, but does that mean that my simulation is an actual mechanistic recreation of the processes that produced the actual data?  I can come up with a hypothesis and write a simulation to support it, but does that mean my hypothesis is supported?  I don't have an answer to this question, but I do worry that simulation only projects can drift dangerously close to being circular (Like I said it can keep me up at night).  I think that simulation is a powerful tool for ecologists, but in the melee of trying to pump out as many papers as possible it can get overused.  These two papers highlight that.  Early and Sax's paper I thought was an excellent use of simulation and I really enjoyed the paper.  Sheldon et al's on the other hand was a good simulation but needed more follow through, preferably in the form of actual data, to have punch.  In the end without that empirical data to support it, it felt like it was just a bit too circular for me to trust the result based on simulation alone.    <br><br><br> <span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&rft.jtitle=Ecology+letters&rft_id=info%3Apmid%2F21955643&rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fresearchblogging.org&rft.atitle=Analysis+of+climate+paths+reveals+potential+limitations+on+species+range+shifts.&rft.issn=1461-023X&rft.date=2011&rft.volume=&rft.issue=&rft.spage=&rft.epage=&rft.artnum=&rft.au=Early+R&rft.au=Sax+DF&rfe_dat=bpr3.included=1;bpr3.tags=Ecology+%2F+Conservation">Early R, & Sax DF (2011).

Re: the circularity issue which you nicely articulate at the end, in the philosophy of science literature that&#39;s known as the &quot;old evidence&quot; problem or the &quot;use construction&quot; problem. Can a theory be confirmed or supported by old evidence, i.e. evidence that was known at the time the theory was constructed? Well, there are some famous cases in science where the answer seems to be &quot;yes&quot;. For instance, the perihelion precession of Mercury (ppM) was known before Einstein came up with general relativity, but the fact that general relativity predicts the ppM was taken as strong evidence in favor of relativity. One standard explanation for this is that Einstein didn&#39;t &quot;use&quot; the ppM in constructing his theory, so that the ppM still counts as an &quot;independent&quot; test of the theory. But this standard answer--that it&#39;s only &quot;use construction&quot; that&#39;s the problem, not &quot;old evidence&quot; in general--itself runs into some problems. Deborah Mayo&#39;s answer, which I like, is that the important thing is that the evidence--whether old or new, used in theory construction or not--constitutes a &quot;severe test&quot; of the theory. That is, the theory would be highly likely to pass the test (predict the evidence) if and only if it were true, and highly likely to fail the test if and only if it were false. *Depending on the context*, it&#39;s possible for even old evidence used in theory construction to still provide a severe test of theory. <br /><br />One can of course avoid all these worries by testing the theory with new evidence!</div>
