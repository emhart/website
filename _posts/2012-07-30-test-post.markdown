We had a good run blogger, but it's time to move on.  I'm joining the ranks of many of my peers and moving my blogging system to [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) combined with [Octopress](http://octopress.org/).  I've spent a lot of time configuring the new blog.  This is mostly because on top of setting up Jekyll and Octopress, I implemented a [Twitter Bootstrap theme](http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/) which took a few evenings to learn my way around. I've also decided to do away with my own webpage.  This is sort of an interesting decision, and I'm not totally sure it's the wisest. Traditional academic webpages have a pretty standard layout.

But I think in the spirit of open science and making everything public, I feel less inclined to have a static webpage describing research, but instead use my "about me" section of the blog as a central hub to various dynamic context such as Figshare, GitHub, Mendeley, etc...  This may mean that people used to a certain webpage might find this difficult or off-putting, but it may appeal to others.  I'm not sure if I'll keep with this style.  But that said, I'm incredibly happy to my new blogging platform and I'm excited to blog more about the upcoming ESA meeting.
