Just for kicks I took the recently posted subscriber data on Ecolog and made this figure and fitted an exponential growth curve to it.  I assumed an initial subscriber base of 100 and estimated monthly growth to be <i>r</i> = 0.0281.  <b>Update</b>  To give a bit more meaning to what that <i>r</i> means, Ecolog has a doubling time (as I calculated it) of ~31 months.  By April of 2014 there will by 26,000 subscribers.  I'll have to check back in with <a href="http://biology.umd.edu/faculty/davidwinouye">David</a> to see if that actually holds true. <div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IqBuNH3CNhc/TmFD6wtAFtI/AAAAAAAAC2E/Z7c75lUn3ws/s1600/ECOLog.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left:1em; margin-right:1em"><img border="0" height="400" width="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-IqBuNH3CNhc/TmFD6wtAFtI/AAAAAAAAC2E/Z7c75lUn3ws/s400/ECOLog.png" /></a></div>  </div>

If you cut out the zero point assumption of 100, the curve fits a lot nicer. It predicts an initial value of around 660 and monthly growth is about half of the value above. I wonder if Inouye has the number of people who signed up when it started?<br /><br />Also, I was doing it in excel. What function did you use to fit the curve in R? There are probably multiple ways to do it...</div>
