Earlier I wrote a post titled <a href="http://currentecology.blogspot.com/2011/08/optimal-ecologist-strategy.html">Optimal ecologist strategy</a>.  My argument there was that to be a successful modern ecologist you needed strong computational skills because your access to modern analytical tools is limited if you don't have good math skills and good programming skills.  Well on Friday I dropped by my old advisor <a href="http://www.uvm.edu/~ngotelli/homepage.html">Nick Gotelli's</a> office to chat about what kinds of confidence intervals to use in a simulation.  We ended up having an hour long chat and I proudly told him about my adventures in python and my belief in the importance of programming skills.  He told me that really it didn't matter if I could program or not.  In his opinion what makes a good faculty hire for an ecologist position is strong empiricism and the ability to carry out field experiments.  <span class="right-caption"><img border="0" height="144" width="256" src="http://cdn-thumbs.viddler.com/thumbnail_2_7fa659fe_v2.jpg" /> <p>Don't get trapped, find that maximum! </p></span> I was a bit surprised at this because I've been laboring under the belief that computational skills are really important and as we move into an era of "<a href="http://oikosjournal.wordpress.com/2011/09/17/questions-about-big-data-in-ecology/">Big Data</a>", faster computers etc... these skills become more and more important in getting a job.  His point though was that engineers and computer scientists will always be out pacing me because these methods are their bread and butter skill set.  He is of course right, for an ecologist I'm a pretty good statistician and a pretty good programmer, but judged by a statistician and a computer scientist my skills at both are mediocre at best. On top of that he argued that more and more people are becoming <a href="http://evol-eco.blogspot.com/2011/07/empirical-divide.html">3M</a> people, so the competition for those jobs is getting harder and harder.  So what do people think is the best strategy for making yourself a good job candidate?  We only have a fixed number of hours in a day, so what skills are the most important for ecologists to focus on?  </div>

I think that there is something fundamentally inadequate with current ecological training. Usually ecologists follow courses in biology and statistics. This produces data-.gatherer, since ecology is not a branch of biology; it matters little which are the biochemical steps of photosynthesis to understand the ecology of photosynthesis. I think that training should be more alike that of McArthur, Tilman and others, that is ecologists should be trained in mathematics and taxonomy. McArthur, for instance, was a mathematician with strong knwoledge of ornithology. But this is a recipe for doing itneresting thing, not for success</div>

Great thoughts. The decision of whether to become a specialist or a generalist is hard. The jack-of-all-trades is a master of none, which could mean that one might not be able to dig as deep into a specific skill if we are spread too thin (or, I guess, deep enough to get by). It gets confusing when the field is changing. So, the normal of ecology 30 years ago is not the normal of ecology 30 years from now. Of course, the normalists of today will be hiring the normalists of tomorrow, so maybe we always need to have a solid foot in the past.<br /><br />I think that big data ecology will still require thoughtful ecological knowledge and creativity. I don&#39;t agree that it will be an ability to do field work per se, but I think the ability to set up a field experiment and the ability to organize and perform complex analyses are analogous. In my experience most field experiments require thinking like an engineer just like most analyses require thinking like a statistician, and many ecologists probably end up half-assing it if they don&#39;t have help (like my last blog post that you commented on!).<br /><br />At the end of the day, it is all external to the fundamental questions that we are asking. In that sense, I am realizing that it could be a limiting factor if it starts to infringe on my ability to come up with good ecological ideas.</div>

I suggest identifying collaborators that A) complement your skill set and B) are compatible with your style and expectations. This isn&#39;t necessarily a cop-out to your question, I would argue that working well with others is a skill. This philosophy has stemmed from the acknowledgment that no matter how skilled I may be become at various statistical or modeling methods (for one example), there are others that will dwarf my ability (as you allude to above). A working knowledge of many subjects will suffice. I think ecologists may try to spread themselves out too thin otherwise. After checking out your &quot;optimal ecologist strategy&quot; post regarding being a generalist, you make a similar point.<br /><br />Dave</div>
