I did make a foray into last year though and gave a talk on it at ESA, and one of the real challenges, something that took weeks and weeks was parameter calibration.  In this paper, the authors address that problem.  They take a well established IBM and apply an evolutionary algorithm (EA)to estimate parameters.  I have to say that this is a really neat approach.  I won't go into too many details because much of the paper is devoted to the guts of their EA that I don't need to go into. In brief what they try and do is use an EA to parameteritize a fish IBM, where the output is biomass of 12 species after 200 years.  In the manuscript they compare biomass outputs for manually calibrated parameter values, EA estimated values and expected values.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jcnUEp-t9Nw/S8YOq6CMWxI/AAAAAAAACYs/A9h1g0mi66I/s1600/dubozfig.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 180px; height: 200px;" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_jcnUEp-t9Nw/S8YOq6CMWxI/AAAAAAAACYs/A9h1g0mi66I/s200/dubozfig.jpg" border="0" alt=""id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5460067728529054482" /></a>  As you can see, they find very accurate estimates with the EA algorithm, and in some cases they even get better results than with the hand calibrated method.  They also note that the EA solutions took a week, and the manual calibration took 6 weeks.  At the same time they don't mention how long the EA took to write or if its generalizable to any IBM they program.  But if it were, the EA would be a great time saver in terms of IBM optimization. I think this is a really great direction to go in for IBM's especially serious IBM's where you need information about parameter uncertainty, and some of their output can even be used as sensitivity analysis.  A pretty cool study overall, and I think maybe something to consider for my post-doc.</div>
